# InvSync

This is a fabric mod for 1.16.x and 1.17.x that Allows you to sync player inventories, health, food level, experience and score across multiple servers! This is accomplished using an sqlite database (that is automatically generated and set up for you). Most mods should have no problem running along side, and modded items will also be sync'd.

## Requirements

- This mod requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) 
- You can get the mod on [Modrith](https://modrinth.com/mod/invsync) or on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/invsync-fabric)

## Getting Started

Setup is very simple. Drop the mod into your mods folder on all the servers you want to sync. Starting a server will generate a config with the following contents:

## IMPORTANT NOTES 

- Configs MUST be identical between all participating servers in order for the mod to function correctly.
